# Air-BnB-Presentation
Excel-derived Presentation on Air BnB Metrics

This project is based upon actual Airbnb data.   The analysis provides insight to a hypothetical client that wishes to invest in an Airbnb hotel in Amsterdam and its neighborhoods. It investigates potentially lucrative property types, neighborhoods with listings, and areas that are in demand. These variables are analyzed using pivot tables in Microsoft Excel in order to determine which locations would maximize potential profit.
